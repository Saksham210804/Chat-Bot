# Chat_BOT_(2)
This project is a C++-based chatbot that utilizes Microsoft's Speech API (SAPI) for speech synthesis, enabling it to communicate responses through natural-sounding speech. While the project does not include voice recognition, it serves as a foundation for building applications that interact with users via audio output.

Key Features:
Speech Synthesis: Converts text-based responses into spoken output using SAPI.
Interactive Chatting: Processes user input (typed) and generates spoken replies.
Customizable Framework: Easily extendable for various use cases like education, personal assistants, or entertainment.
Technologies:
Language: C++
API: Microsoft Speech API (SAPI)
This project is ideal for developers exploring text-to-speech capabilities and integrating speech synthesis into interactive applications.
